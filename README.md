# ASP.NET MVC Comic Book Gallery

This project was built using a 239 minute course on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>. In this course I used ASP.NET MVC to build a dynamic website. The course taught the bascis of ASP.NET MVC while building a comic book gallery. Along the way I created a new project in Visual Studio, added controllers and views, model data, and created repositories.
