# ASP.NET MVC Comic Book Gallery

This a project built following a course on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>. This course helps teach the basics of ASP.NET MVC. While learning the basics we build a comic book gallery website using Visual Studio Commmunity. We learn how to create a new project, add controllers and views, model data, and create local repositories.
